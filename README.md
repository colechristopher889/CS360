This is an unfinished Android app for inventory management. I plan to continue developing it for commercial use in the near future. I need a very simple app, development will continue as I become more familiar with the Android ecosystem.


    Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
    This app was designed to provide a simple inventory app with a login screen.
    
    What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
    My design is not currently successful. It will eventually have screens for login as well as a grid view for the inventory items. Some CRUD functionality has been implemented but it is not finished.
    
    How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?
    I decided to spend much of my time planning and reviewing code examples. In hindsight, I would have spent more time implementing features and testing and less time in the planning phase.
    
    How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?
    My code is not functional. The testing process I would follow is to load a proper VM and troubleshoot the code.
    
    Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
    I attempted to implement the SQLite code in a few different ways, I was ultimately unsuccessful. I will continue to develop this app.
    
    In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
    None. :)
